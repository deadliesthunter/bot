it is createed through sequential model( presents many layers between input / output)
This layer is typically added as the final layer in a Sequential model designed for classification tasks. Here's how it fits into the overall model architecture:

Input Layer: Receives the input data.
Hidden Layers: One or more layers with neurons and activation functions like ReLU.
Dropout Layers (optional): Regularization layers to prevent overfitting.
Output Layer: A Dense layer with len(trainY[0]) neurons and a 'softmax' activation function.
